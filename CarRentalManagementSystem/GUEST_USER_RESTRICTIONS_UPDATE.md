# Guest User Restrictions - Implementation Update

## Overview
Updated the AI chatbot to ensure guest users (not logged in) receive ONLY general information about car rental services, with no mention of admin flows, customer flows, or internal processes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Guest Context (`BuildGuestContext`)

**Before:**
- Mentioned "admin approval" in step-by-step process
- Referenced "booking requests" and operational workflows
- Included specific percentages and internal processes

**After:**
- Completely generic car rental service information
- No mention of admin, staff, or operational processes
- Focus on general service offerings and vehicle information
- Removed all workflow references

**New Context:**
```
- Wide selection of vehicles for all occasions
- Convenient online platform
- Competitive pricing
- Professional customer service
- Flexible rental options
- Various vehicle types available
- Short-term and long-term rentals
- Comprehensive vehicle information
- Customer support assistance
- Convenient pickup and return
```

### 2. Enhanced Guest System Prompt (`GetDefaultGuestPrompt`)

**Stricter Restrictions:**
- **NEVER** mention booking processes, payment processes, or account creation
- **NEVER** discuss login procedures, approval workflows, or operational procedures
- **NEVER** reference internal business processes
- Focus ONLY on general service descriptions and vehicle types
- Redirect operational questions to customer service

### 3. Expanded Message Filtering (`IsMessageAppropriateForRole`)

**New Blocked Keywords for Guests:**
- `\"booking approval\"`, `\"approval process\"`, `\"staff\"`, `\"employee\"`
- `\"login\"`, `\"sign in\"`, `\"create account\"`, `\"register\"`
- `\"how to book\"`, `\"booking process\"`, `\"make reservation\"`

### 4. Enhanced Response Filtering

#### Updated `RemoveAccountSpecificTerminology`:
**New Filtered Terms:**
- `\"create an account\"` → `\"contact us\"`
- `\"sign in\"` → `\"get assistance\"`
- `\"booking process\"` → `\"rental services\"`
- `\"admin approval\"` → `\"processing\"`
- `\"booking request\"` → `\"rental inquiry\"`

#### Updated `RemoveAdminTerminology`:
**New Filtered Terms:**
- `\"admin approval\"` → `\"processing\"`
- `\"administrator\"` → `\"staff\"`
- `\"approval process\"` → `\"rental process\"`
- `\"booking approval\"` → `\"rental confirmation\"`

#### Updated `RemoveStaffTerminology`:
**New Filtered Terms:**
- `\"staff\"` → `\"our team\"`
- `\"employee\"` → `\"team member\"`
- `\"booking approval\"` → `\"rental confirmation\"`
- `\"approval workflow\"` → `\"rental process\"`

## Guest User Experience

### ✅ What Guests CAN Learn About:
- General car rental services
- Available vehicle types and brands
- Basic service offerings (short-term, long-term rentals)
- Company information
- General pricing concepts
- Vehicle categories
- Customer support availability

### ❌ What Guests CANNOT Learn About:
- How to create accounts or login
- Booking processes or workflows
- Admin approval procedures
- Staff operations
- Customer dashboard features
- Payment processes
- Internal operational procedures
- Specific account management

### Sample Guest Interactions:

**Appropriate Guest Questions:**
- \"What types of cars do you have?\"
- \"Tell me about your rental services\"
- \"What vehicle brands are available?\"
- \"Do you offer long-term rentals?\"

**Inappropriate Guest Questions (Will be Blocked):**
- \"How do I book a car?\" → Redirected to customer service
- \"How do I create an account?\" → Redirected to customer service
- \"What's the approval process?\" → Redirected to customer service
- \"How do I login?\" → Redirected to customer service

## Security Benefits

1. **Information Isolation**: Guests cannot learn about internal workflows
2. **Business Process Protection**: No exposure of operational procedures
3. **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between public information and internal processes
4. **Compliance**: Ensures guests only access appropriate public information

## Testing the Changes

To verify the implementation:

1. **Access without login** - Chatbot should only provide generic car rental information
2. **Ask about booking** - Should be redirected to customer service
3. **Ask about accounts** - Should be redirected to customer service  
4. **Ask about admin processes** - Should be blocked completely
5. **Ask about vehicle types** - Should provide general information

The guest experience is now completely isolated from any internal business processes, ensuring visitors only receive appropriate public information about the car rental services.
